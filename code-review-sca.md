# Code review and Static Code Analysis or Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Demand patience and concentration.

Done in Coding and Testing phases.

Manual review: review security controls like logins, input validation, authentication, authorization.

Automatic review: SAST tool can be long and have a lot of false positive but they are hints of where to look at and can lead to more than just security issues (performances...).

We should have basic security hygiene.
